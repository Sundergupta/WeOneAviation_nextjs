                    The basic issue with 99% of the flight training programmes is a need for
                    follow-up assistance for students&apos; requirements. This implies that
                    99% of student pilots who complete flight training programmes are
                    dismissed by their flight schools and are forced to hunt for work with
                    just 200–250 hours of flying experience and a basic CPL. And doing so
                    puts the newly-minted pilots up for career failure: looking for work
                    with such poor credentials leads to unemployment, misery, desperation,
                    and the expiry of pilot money.
