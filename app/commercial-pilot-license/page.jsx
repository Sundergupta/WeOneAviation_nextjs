                        The journey to becoming a professional aviator begins with obtaining a
                        <strong> Commercial Pilot License (CPL)</strong>. This license authorizes an
                        individual to operate aircraft commercially and opens doors to careers in
                        airlines, charter services, cargo operations, and corporate aviation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before enrolling in a pilot training program, it is essential for students
                        to understand the basic eligibility criteria set by DGCA. These
                        requirements ensure that every aspiring pilot meets the academic, medical,
                        and skill standards needed to operate an aircraft safely and efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meeting the CPL eligibility criteria is the first checkpoint in your
                        aviation journey. Once cleared, candidates can proceed with DGCA ground
                        classes, medical examinations, and eventually, flight training to earn
                        their wings.
