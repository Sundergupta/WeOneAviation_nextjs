                    DGCA Ground Classes are where students prepare for the DGCA exams. It’s
                    similar to regular coaching institutes like IIT or MBBS coaching — the
                    only difference is that here you’ll master all DGCA subjects required
                    to obtain a Commercial Pilot License (CPL).

                <p>
                    DGCA Ground Classes are classes where students prepare themselves for
                    the DGCA exam. It’s a normal coaching class, like IIT and MBBS coaching
                    classes. The only difference is that after taking DGCA ground classes,
                    you will master the DGCA exam, which is required to obtain a pilot
                    license.

                <h2>What Is DGCA?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is the main government
                    body that controls and regulates all aviation-related activities in
                    India. It makes rules for flying, conducts DGCA exams, and issues pilot
                    licenses. To become a pilot, you must follow DGCA regulations and clear
                    DGCA exams.
                </p>

                        flight instructors.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Approves Flying Schools:</strong> Only DGCA-approved schools
                        can train pilots in India.
